[Github](https://github.com/ayushkul/react-weather-app)

#### 1. Explore Project Structure
Analyze the primary folders and files:
- `public/`: Contains `index.html`.
- `src/`: Main source code with components, styles, and main application files.

#### 2 Understand the Entry Point
Locate `index.js`:
- Understand how the main `App` component is rendered.

#### 3. Analyze Main Components
- **App.js**:
  - Main component that includes the `Weather` component.
- **Weather.js**:
  - Handles fetching and displaying weather data.
  - Initializes state with default city and weather data.
  - Uses lifecycle methods to fetch data.
  - Contains methods for API calls and rendering weather information.

#### 4. API Key Integration
Identify where the API key is required for fetching weather data from OpenWeatherMap.

#### 5. Styling
Analyze CSS files:
- `App.css` for main app styles.
- `Weather.css` for weather-specific styles.

#### 6. Modify and Experiment
- Change default state values (e.g., default city).
